    "description": "You require very complex passwords that are impossible to memorize and you ask people to change them every month. On the other hand password recovery needs to go through a manned helpdesk.",
    "event": "People start using password generators. Worse than that, they need help to memorize them and very frequently write them down on paper.",
    "consequences": "Employees start to think of passwords very differently. Sharing one's password stops being an issue anymore. The greatest embarassment comes when a friend tells you that when reading a newspaper article about Global Sparks, he saw someone's password in the background of the accompanying photograph.",
